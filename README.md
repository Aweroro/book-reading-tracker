This application is hosted here: https://book-reading-tracker-f73c2.web.app/

This is a Next.js application that allows users to keep track of books by adding, updating and removing them across different reading status categories.

Firebase is used here for user authentication to protect individual user's data and profile.

The firebase firestore is used as the primary database and used to store user generated content.

React toasify is used to show engaging UI indications for successful user actions such as signing in and signing and CRUD actions.

Tailwind CSS is used for the styling and design of the UI, making the application look modern, interactive and responsive across different devices.

The application is primarily written in Typescript which is a superset of Javascript that ensures type safety and helps detect and prevent errors.

Feel free to try the application and your feedback will be welcomed

Thank you.
